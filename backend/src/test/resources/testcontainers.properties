# Enable Testcontainers reuse for faster test execution
# This file should be placed in ~/.testcontainers.properties but we document it here
# Users should create this file in their home directory:
# testcontainers.reuse.enable=true

# Note: Container reuse is enabled in IntegrationTestBase.kt via .withReuse(true)
# For this to work, the above property must be set in ~/.testcontainers.properties
